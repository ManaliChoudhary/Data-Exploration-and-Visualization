# Data Exploration and Visualization
## State of global happiness and the potential factors affecting it
<br>

#### The world is facing a tough time recently, ever since the ending of 2019 due to the ongoing crisis like bush fires, earthquake, corona virus outbreak, riots and many more. All this has led to issues like unemployment, losses of lives, health issues, instability in the emotional and mental well-being. Clearly, 2020 has not been so great for the whole world until now and happiness has been an urgent need to make this world a happy place again. This gives us the opportunity to look back over the past few years and analyse what can be improved to kick start with a new beginning. This gives each one of us an opportunity to stop for a while, define and explore what happiness really means to us so that we can rectify our mistakes from the past. ‘In the Pursuit of Happiness’ allows each one of us to realize the state of global happiness until now based on different subjective well-being factors and also the importance of acknowledging the vital role of mental health well-being for a happy life(Hall & Helliwell, 2014). It builds a standard fair platform or measures and study of happiness factors in all countries around the globe. It, hence, tries to answer some of our questions regarding the perceptions of happiness based on the findings from the data exploration done in the previous stage of this project. For example,
#### • Nation wise happiness state of the globe. Considering the race, history, geography, and the development of nations.
#### • The role of Money/ Economy as a critical subjective well-being happiness factor along with the others.
#### • The importance of mental health well-being in relation to the top ranked happiest countries.
#### This narrative visualization can be the first step for the general public, social activists, policy makers, communities, governments to come up with a solution for a change in the society and make it a better place.<br><br>
